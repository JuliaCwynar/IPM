          <p>Platform to help animals improve/simplify their life quality in shelter or find a new home. We want to create a website that will allow the user to take a pet from the shelter for a walk, to become it's patron with a monthly contribution for food or equipment, or even to adopt the selected dog.</p>
          <p>Platform should work as well as a link between person and shelter itself.</p>
